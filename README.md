# Tempora Pray

A meditation app for iOS. I plan to include original translations from the *On Prayer* of Evagrius Ponticus and Brother Lawrence's *Spiritual Maxims*.  (See my [website](alexpoulos.com) for sample translations)

At present (2019-05-23), the timer functionality works correctly. I'm in the process of implementing the UI for changing for selecting a meditation. The back-end is presently a simple combo of Spring Boot and Mongo, which I eventually plan to move onto AWS once the app is ready for the store.
